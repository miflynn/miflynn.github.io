	<h1>Michael Flynn</h1>
	<p>Welcome! I anm a graduate student researcher in the physics department at the University of California, Davis. 
	   Here you can find a summary of my research interests and see what I have been working on lately.
	   I primarily focus on topological phases of matter and aspects of non-integrable quantum dynamics.
	   Recently, machine learning has also played a role in my research.</p>
